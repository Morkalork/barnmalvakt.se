# barnmalvakt.se

So this might not be the most ethical of sites, but who cares, eh? Tax is theft, yadda-yadda, I have no political views, the page is a joke.

I made the page to test out a mix of react/redux/react-router/webpack/ and possibly other stuff (gonna add myself some translation at some point).

## Installation

I don't know why you'd want to install this since it's already running at [http://www.barnmalvakt.se](barnmalvakt.se), but if you need to do:

`npm install`

Then to run it, open a terminal (if you haven't at this point then how did you run the above command?) and run:

```
npm run start
```

Then visit localhost:8080.
